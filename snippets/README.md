# C++ Snippets
A collection of C++ code snippets that demonstrate the API of the C++ standard

All examples are implemented as Catch2 tests. To execute tests in CLion,
manually add a new Run Configuration for Catch. 

Requires MSVS C++ compiler (Windows), as some API like `std::future` are
not supported in g++.
